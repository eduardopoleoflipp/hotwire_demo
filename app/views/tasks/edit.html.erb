<!--
  Rules:
  - Only the first instance of the response frame will be matched against the corresponding
  browser frame
  - Only the content inside the (browser) frame that initiated the request will be replaced
  => So there's no point in having multiple frames with the same id. You want to be specific 
  about what you want to swap.

  - Nested frames on either side (server response or browser) have not effect on this either.
  => Only the immediate parent frame gets the replaced by the response matching frame.

  - This works for both links and forms submissions

  All these rules are summarized in the first paragraph of https://turbo.hotwired.dev/handbook/frames
